# Vidar

A rewrite of the [Thor Flash Utility](https://github.com/Samsung-Loki/Thor) in Python. It is currently under development and not usable. Once it is in a working state, it will be added as a flash tool option in [Thor GUI](https://github.com/ethical-haquer/Thor_GUI).

### Why Vidar?

In Norse mythology, [Vidar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%AD%C3%B0arr) is one of Odin's sons, and is one of Thor's brothers.

### What will Vidar be like when it's finished?

Vidar will be like Thor, but written in Python.

## Disclaimer

Currently, Vidar is in a Pre-Alpha stage. That means it is under development and not ready for end users.
