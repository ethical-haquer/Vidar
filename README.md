# Vidar

A rewrite of the [Thor Flash Utility](https://github.com/Samsung-Loki/Thor) in Python with a GUI. It is currently under development and not usable. Once it is in a working state, this repository will be deleted and it will become [Thor GUI](https://github.com/ethical-haquer/Thor_GUI) v0.5.0. Also, starting with the release of Thor GUI v0.5.0, Thor GUI will be renamed Vidar. 

### Why Vidar?

In Norse mythology, [Vidar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%AD%C3%B0arr) is one of Odin's sons, and is one of Thor's brothers.

### What will Vidar be like when it's finished?

Vidar will look just like Thor GUI, but instead of using Thor externally, it will be self-contained. Basically, Vidar will be like Thor written in Python and then combined with Thor GUI.

## Disclaimer

Currently, Vidar is in a Pre-Alpha stage. That means it is under development and not ready for end users.

## Known Bugs

- Toggling theme doesn't do anything.
- Toggling tool-tips doesn't do anything.

## Implemented Thor commands

- [x] help
- [x] exit / quit
